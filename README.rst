Unofficial RightNow Media Kodi plugin
=====================================

This Kodi plugin is not endorsed by RightNow Media. Please don't contact them for support.

It was created by reverse engineering the web API calls made by the Android Kodi app.

Installation
------------

1. Download plugin.video.rightnow-media.zip
2. Put the zip file somewhere where Kodi can see it.
3. From the min Kodi interface go to System -> Settings -> Install from zip file
4. Select the zip file to install
5. Click on My add-ons -> Video add-ons -> RightNow media
6. Click Configure
7. Add your credentials for authenticating with RightNow Media
8. Your email/password are only stored locally on the Kodi device. A programmer can verify this by looking at the freely available source code.
9. RightNow Media plugin can now be used from the Videos -> Add-ons tab of the home screen
10. God bless!
