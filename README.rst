Installation
------------

7. Add your credentials for authenticating with RightNow Media
8. Your email/password are only stored locally on the Kodi device; I don't harvest them. A programmer can verify this by looking at the freely available source code.

10. God bless!

Irony

My internet connection speed is so poor, most of the time I can't stream the content without frequent pauses!
